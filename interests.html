                <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                <p>3D printing has been one of my most rewarding hobbies over the past four years. Owning a Creality Ender 3 has allowed me to explore creativity and functionality by producing hundreds of useful items and playful gimmicks. While the Ender 3 is a great starting point, it came with its challenges. Over time, I resolved them through a series of upgrades, including a PEI build plate for better adhesion, silicone bed springs for improved stability, and a filament runout sensor to avoid mid-print failures.</p>

                <p>One of my proudest achievements was installing a BTT SKU Mini E3 V3.0 silent motherboard and writing custom firmware to optimize its performance. This process deepened my understanding of both hardware and software, merging technical problem-solving with creativity. The journey of tinkering, fixing, and improving my printer has not only enhanced its capabilities but also reinforced my appreciation for how accessible and transformative 3D printing technology can be.</p>

                <h2>Cars</h2>
                <p>Working on cars has been a rewarding way for me to engage with hands-on problem-solving and mechanical engineering. Over the years, I’ve owned vehicles like a BMW E46, a Mitsubishi Lancer, and a Subaru WRX, each with its unique quirks and challenges. These cars have given me the opportunity to fix a wide range of issues, from routine maintenance to more complex repairs, deepening my understanding of automotive systems.</p>
                    <p>Through these experiences, I’ve developed patience and an appreciation for the intricacies of vehicle mechanics.Whether it’s diagnosing a difficult issue or performing a precise repair, working on cars has been an invaluable technical skill that has saved me significant time and money. This hands-on approach allows me to handle repairs efficiently, avoid costly shop visits, and ensure my vehicles are maintained to a high standard.</p>

                <h2>Golfing</h2>
                <p>Golfing has been a rewarding way to combine skill, strategy, and relaxation. Over time, I’ve worked to refine my technique and improve my game, focusing on everything from driving accuracy to putting precision. This attention to detail not only enhances my performance on the course but also minimizes the need for costly lessons or equipment fixes, saving both time and money. Golfing is a sport that continuously challenges me while offering the satisfaction of tangible progress.</p>
